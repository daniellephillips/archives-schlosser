  <h3>The Story of Sharon Schlosser: <small class="text-muted">A Mystery Unsolved</small></h3>
  <p>On the cold autumn morning of October 20, 1992, Sharon Frances Schlosser, a beloved mother and respected member of her community, vanished without a trace. What began as an ordinary day quickly unraveled into a nightmare when Sharon never arrived at her intended business meeting in Mount Vernon, Washington. Days of desperate searching by her family and local authorities led to a grim discovery: Sharon’s lifeless body was found floating in the dark, murky waters of the Columbia River, her skull fractured, her body bearing the signs of a violent end.</p>

  <p>The discovery shocked the quiet community of Clackamas, Oregon, and sent waves of fear and suspicion through those who knew her. How could a woman with so much life and love be torn from the world so brutally? Who was responsible for this horrific crime? The chilling circumstances of her death left the community reeling, and the more details that emerged, the darker the mystery became. Despite years of investigation, the case remains unsolved, leaving behind a haunting trail of unanswered questions and a family still desperately searching for justice.</p>

  <p>What follows is a narrative that combines the facts from archived articles, interviews, and my reflections as someone who has become intimately connected with this tragic tale. My goal is to shine a light on the details that have remained in the shadows for far too long, in the hopes of finally bringing justice to Sharon and closure to her family.</p>

  <h4>Connected by Fate to Sharon's Story</h4>

  <p>My name is Danielle Phillips, and I live in the very boathouse that once belonged to Sharon and Charles Schlosser at the Columbia River Yacht Club. The serene beauty of the river contrasts starkly with the grim history that haunts this place. As I settled into this community, Sharon's story became more than just a local legend—it became a call to action. The more I learned, the more I felt compelled to piece together the fragments of her life and untimely death.

  <p>What follows is a narrative that combines the facts from archived articles, interviews, and my reflections as someone who has become intimately connected with this tragic tale. My goal is to shine a light on the details that have remained in the shadows for far too long, in the hopes of finally bringing justice to Sharon and closure to her family.</p>


  <h4>The Fateful Journey</h4>
  <p>On October 20, 1992, Sharon Schlosser left her home in Clackamas, Oregon, supposedly on her way to a business meeting in Mount Vernon, Washington. She never arrived. A week later, her lifeless body was discovered in the Columbia River, her death ruled a homicide caused by severe head injuries. Suspicion quickly turned to her husband, Charles M. Schlosser, though no criminal charges were ever brought against him. Further suspicion arose when a witness claimed that Charles had offered him a Corvette and money to kill Sharon (Oregonian, October 23, 2002).</p>
  
  <h4>Legal Battles and Investigations</h4>
  <p>After Sharon's death, a series of legal battles ensued. A federal civil trial over her life insurance ended inconclusively (Portland Tribune, July 28, 2003). Her family, unwilling to let her memory fade, filed a wrongful death suit against Charles, accusing him of orchestrating her murder and attempting to shield his assets from potential civil judgments (<a href="https://daniellephillips.github.io/archives-schlosser/sharonarticles.pdf">Oregonian, October 14, 2002</a>).</p>
  
  <h4>Family's Quest for Justice</h4>
  <p>Sharon’s children from a previous marriage have been relentless in their pursuit of justice, firmly believing in Charles’s involvement in their mother’s death. Their dedication stems from a deep desire not only for criminal accountability but also to honor Sharon's memory and bring peace to their family. (<a href="https://daniellephillips.github.io/archives-schlosser/sharonarticles.pdf">Oregonian, October 23, 2002</a>).</p>

  <h4>Key Figures in the Case</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Detective Pieter Van Dyke - Investigated the circumstances of Sharon's death and Charles Schlosser's statements.</li>
    <li>Detective Karl Hutchison - Involved in the case.</li>
    <li>Gary Muncy - Sheriff's detective assigned to the case.</li>
    <li>Sam Hooson - Testified regarding Charles Schlosser's alleged murder proposition involving a Corvette and $2,000.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Living in the Columbia River Yacht Club has been an immersive experience, one that ties me to Sharon Schlosser’s tragic tale. As I continue to explore her story, I am committed to shedding light on the details that have remained in the shadows for far too long. This is not just about writing a book; it's about bringing a sense of closure and justice for Sharon and her family.</p>
